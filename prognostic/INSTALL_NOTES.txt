#### INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS ####
##############################

1. INSTALL NODE.JS (https://nodejs.org/en/)
node.js is not used per se, we need node.js to get npm, 
node package manager to be abel to install stuff from
different repositories from the command line.

2. CRAETE AN EMPTY FOLDER AND NAVIGATE INTO IT FROM THE COMMAND LINE

3. RUN: npx create-react-app my-app

4. COPY THE FODLER "node_modeuls" INTO YOUR PROGNOSTIC FOLDER

5. DELETE THE my-app FODLER THAT YOU CREATED IN STEP 3

6. RUN ALL COMMANDS LISTET IN THE "DEPENDENCIES" SECTION

6. NAVIGATE INTO THE PROGNOSTIC FOLDER AND RUN: npm start

7. IF SUCCESSFUL, YOU SHOULD SEE A REALLY NICE PAGE.

#### SOME USEFUL INFORMATION ####
#################################

- The src/components folder contains our cosutom components that we create, name them with a .jsx extension.

- In the src/app.js file we attatch our components in the render method, if you take a look at it, you see it have
  an <Navigationbar/> and an <AllocationTab/> for now.

- The src/index.js file renders the <app/> component into an DOM-element, in this case the element named 'root'.

- To build an optimized version of the app, run 'npm build', it will create an build folder that you basically can 
  upload to a server directly if you just change the file extension to .php from .html, or try it locally directly 
	(some file-path can require tweaking)
	
- The node_modules folder and the build folder are in the .gitignore file, so any changes in those folders will not be
  pushed to GitHub, this means:
	
			1. If you install dependencies with npm, like interact.JS, it will be downloaded to your own machine but not to the
				 repo on GitHub, so you need to provide the other members with the npm commando to install it.
				 
			2. We can use the demo folder to put versions that we build with "npm build", just to have something to show in one place
				 to the client and Jan without needing to install node.js and all the dependencies.
